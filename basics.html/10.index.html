    <h2>Precedence</h2>
    <p>
      Operator precedence in JavaScript determines the order of execution of
      each individual operation in an arithmetic calculation or expression. A
      statement or an expression in any programming language could involve some
      arithmetic calculations with more than one operation. For instance,
      consider the following statement: for example- 5+3*20 <br />
      There are two opertions in the precedence one is addition first and then
      multiplication and other is multiplication first and then addition.In the
      precedence these two operations are important because in precedence order
      are important.In the following precedence example order is compulsory.so
      in the order type of thing precedence is used.
    </p>
    <h2>associativity</h2>
    <p>
      In some situations, JavaScript Operator Precedence alone cannot resolve
      all ambiguity to yield consistent results of expressions. Associativity
      defines the direction to be followed when executing the operations in a
      statement. It comes into the picture when statements contain operators
      that have the same precedence. In order to understand completely why
      associativity is even needed in the first place, let's take a look at the
      following example. for example- 8/4*2 <br />
      There are two opertions in the associativity are left to right and right to
      left operation is used in this upper example.When divide first 
       and then multiplication in associativity it is used the left to right direction.
     When multiplication first and then divide in associativity it is used the right to left
     direction.Associativity is used when order is not valid.
