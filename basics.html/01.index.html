    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <p>
      Javascript is a lightweight,cross-platform,single-threaded,and interpreted
      compiled programming language.It is also known as the scripting language
      for webpages. It can be used for both Client-side as well as Server-side
      developments. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many
      non-browser environments also use it.JavaScript is a weakly typed language
      (dynamically typed).JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type
      of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like
      Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators,
      control structures, and statements.

    <h2>Role in Web Development</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed
        in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive
        web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading
        the entire page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most websites use JavaScript for validation and to support external
        applications, including PDF documents, widgets, flash applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Various JavaScript frameworks are used for developing and building
        robust web applications. In an application like Google Maps, if users
        want to explore a map, all they have to do is click and drag the mouse
        to get a detailed view. This is powered by JavaScript, which interacts
        with the browser without communicating with the servers. Popular
        JavaScript front-end frameworks that help build web apps are React
        Native, React, Angular and Vue. Netflix and PayPal were developed with
        AngularJS JavaScript framework and Application Programming Interfaces
        (APIs).
      </li>
      <li>
        Some of the worldâ€™s largest tech companies use JavaScript to better the
        user experience.Some famous websites built by the use of JavaScript are
        Google, YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, Twitter, and
        LinkedIn, to name a few.
