    <h2>Role of Operators in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      Operators is performing some operations and some tasks in the code.There
      are many types of operators in the JavaScript like Arthematic operator..
      +(Addition),-(subtraction),*(multiplication),**(exponential),/(division),%(Remainder),++(Increment)
      ,--(decrement).. ,Comparison Operators.. ==(equal to) many more.. ,Logical
      Operators &&(and),||(or),!(not).. ,Assignment Operators
      =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,**=.Operators are used in the logic part of the code to
      perform Some logic and perform many tasks to maintain the code and easily
      run the code and make it readable. It is essential in programming because
      it is used to perform such operations and make a logic in the code it is
      used in the programming part.Depending on its type, an operator
      manipulates an arithmetic or logical value, or operand, in a specific way
      to generate a specific result. From handling simple arithmetic functions
      to facilitating the execution of complex algorithms, like security
      encryption, operators play an important role in the programming world.
