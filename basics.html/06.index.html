    <h2>Variables---</h2>
    <p>
      If you or someone else needs to modify or fix a piece of code, having
      meaningful variable names makes it easier to identify which variables are
      involved and their purpose. This speeds up the debugging process and
      reduces the chances of introducing errors when making changes.This
      meaningful Variables help them to fast the process.In future to read the
      code to explain a good way to declare a meaningful variables to easily
      read this and identify this.

    <ul>
      <li>Readability and Understandability</li>
      <li>Maintainability and Debugging</li>
      <li>Collaboration and Teamwork</li>
      <li>Self-Documentation</li>
      <li>Code Reusability</li>
    </ul>
    <p> For ex... -let User = "Jatin"; <br>
                In this variable it esily identify user is jatin to increase the Readability of the variable or code.</p>
