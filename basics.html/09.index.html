    <h2>Unary Operator---</h2>
    <p>
      These operators require one operand for operation. Providing two or more
      can result in a syntax error. Here are some examples of operators that
      fall under this category. <br /><br />
      the typeof operator--- <br />
      The typeof operator returns the data type of a value. It requires only one
      operand. Here's an example: typeof "jatin" #string
    </p>
    <h2>Binary operator---</h2>
    <p>
      These operators require two operands for operation. If one or more than
      two operands are provided, such operators result in a syntax error. <br />
      Let's look at some operators that fall under this category-- <br />
      Arthematic Operators--- <br />
      All arithmetic operators are binary operators. You have the first operand
      on the left of the operator, and the second operand on the right of the
      operator. Here are some examples: <br />
      10+20 #30
    </p>
    <h2>Ternary Operator---</h2>
    <p>
      These operators require three operands. In JavaScript, there is one
      operator that falls under this category â€“ the conditional operator. In
      other languages, perhaps, there could be more examples. <br />
      The conditional operator--- <br />
      the conditonal operator requires three operands <br />
      here is an example of ternary operator... <br />
      const score = 80 <br>
      const scoreRating = score > 45 ? "Good" : "Poor" <br>
      #"Good"
    </p>
